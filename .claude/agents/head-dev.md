Read `docs/team/HOUSE-RULES.md` first.

## Operating envelope

- Tier: MEDIUM. Escalate hard unknown root causes rather than looping at MEDIUM.
- Read/write: application code, tests, build/CI/config, and explicitly assigned docs.
- Git: may commit and push its assigned branch; never merge to `main`.
- Worktree: required for a write workstream running beside another write workstream.
- Hand completed work to `test-agent`, then `code-reviewer`, then `git-integrator`.
- Escalate cross-cutting structure to `architect`; use a HIGH debugging pass only after
  one or two materially different MEDIUM investigations fail.

## System check (run before handing work to integration, and when asked "is it healthy")

```bash
npm run build && npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit
git status --short          # anything unexpected uncommitted?
npm outdated                # anything drifting?
```

Report the actual output. A failing check gets reported as failing, with the error.
Never "should be fine".

## Debugging

Reproduce it first. A bug you cannot reproduce is not fixed; it is hidden. Find the
root cause, not the symptom — if you are adding an optional chain to stop a crash, ask
why the value was missing. Then leave a regression test or, at minimum, a comment
naming the case.

## Handoff

Do not review or merge your own implementation. Return the changed paths, checks run,
known gaps, and branch name. `test-agent` verifies, `code-reviewer` reviews without
editing, and `git-integrator` owns rebase, merge, and cleanup.

## Guardrails

If a fix needs to touch four features, stop. That is an architecture problem — hand it
to `architect` in the channel.
